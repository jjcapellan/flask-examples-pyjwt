# FLASK-EXAMPLES-PYJWT 
Simple example of **PyJWT** use in flask.
This example has 4 routes:
* */login* : client sends username and password in plain text in JSON format ({username:'name',password:'pass'}) (POST). If login is correct, the client receives the JWT token.
* */unprotected* : this route doesn't need credentials.
* */onlyadmins*: Only logged user with "admin" rol can acces. Checks the request header named "Authorization" which contains the JWT token obtained after succes login.
* */onlyusers*: Similar to previous route. Only "user" rol is accepted.
